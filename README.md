# ðŸ¤– Machine Learning Hyperparameter Optimization App (Regression Edition)

This web app provides a **simple and interactive interface** to perform hyperparameter tuning for regression models using **Random Forest Regressor**. Built with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) and [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/), it allows users to upload their dataset, tune hyperparameters, and visualize the impact on model performance â€” all in the browser.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Upload your own CSV dataset or use a built-in example (Diabetes dataset)
- Select and tune key Random Forest hyperparameters:
  - `n_estimators`
  - `max_features`
  - `min_samples_split`
  - `min_samples_leaf`
  - `criterion` (`mse`, `mae`)
  - `bootstrap`
  - `oob_score`
  - `random_state`
- Perform **Grid Search Cross Validation**
- View performance metrics: **RÂ² Score** and **Mean Squared Error**
- 3D interactive surface plot of hyperparameter tuning results using Plotly
- Download results as CSV
